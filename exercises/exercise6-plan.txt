Implementation plan:

- Create database, raw tables
- Inserting all data to raw tables
- loop over rows in the raw table, for each row
	- go through functions to create normalized rows, for each function
		- get unique id for the data created for tables (tweet, user and hashtag)
		- check if the current data is in the new table
			- if yes, return the existing id
			- if no
				- create row in corresponding new tables
				- create id for the new row
	- join the tables by relation
		- check whether there is relation of tweet and user, tweet and hashtag, tweet and user mentions 
			- if yes, return relationship id in the relationship table
			- if no, create new relationship row in the relationship table
- after looping the rows
	- in each table, get the descriptive statistics
	- in relationship table, get descriptive statistics about tweet/user, hashtag/tweet and user mentioned/tweet
