exercise 7

Similar as in exercise 6, I explore statistics for tweet/ user/ hashtag and user mentioned.


1. number of distinct users in the data set: 36012

I notice that the number of records in the user table in dataset is 56744. The difference of the two numbers dues to the fact that all users even just mentioned in the tweet we explored is included in the table.

  code: 
	SELECT *
	FROM user
	WHERE  user_created IS NOT NULL;

2. average number of tweets per user with multiple tweets: 2.1870

  code:
	Select AVG(Z.COUNT) 
	FROM (
		SELECT COUNT(twitter_tweet_id) AS [COUNT]
		FROM tweet
		GROUP BY tweet_user_id
		HAVING COUNT(twitter_tweet_id)  > 1
	) AS Z

3. Average number of hashtags in tweets: 1.9039

  code: 
	SELECT SUM(tweet_hashtag_mention_count) / count(twitter_tweet_id)
	FROM tweet

4. Max number of hashtags in tweets: 16

  code:
	SELECT COUNT(hashtag_id), tweet_id
	FROM tweet_hashtag
	GROUP BY tweet_id
	ORDER BY COUNT(hashtag_id) DESC

5. Number of tweets with hash tags: 38035

  code:
	SELECT COUNT(distinct tweet_id)
	FROM tweet_hashtag

6. Percent of overall data set that has hashtags: 53.80%

  code:
	SELECT COUNT(distinct h.tweet_id) * 10000 / COUNT(t.id)
	FROM tweet_hashtag h, tweet t
	WHERE h.tweet_id = t.id


7. Average number of user mentions in tweets: 1.3330

  code:
	SELECT SUM(tweet_user_mention_count) / count(twitter_tweet_id)
	FROM tweet

8. Max number of user mentions in tweets: 14

  code:
	SELECT COUNT(mentioned_user_id), tweet_id
	FROM tweet_user_mentions
	GROUP BY tweet_id
	ORDER BY COUNT(mentioned_user_id) DESC

9. Number of tweets with user mentions: 38039

  code:
	SELECT COUNT(distinct tweet_id)
	FROM tweet_user_mentions

10. Percent of overall data set that has user mentions: 75.49%

  code:
	SELECT COUNT(distinct u.tweet_id) * 10000 / COUNT(t.id)
	FROM tweet_user_mentions u, tweet t
	WHERE u.tweet_id = t.id
